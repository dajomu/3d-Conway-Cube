[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on a cube, in your browser

This is a quick project for a round of code golf at work. 
Eagle eyed observers will spot that Conway's original rules havent been implemented properly.
This is due to a bit of experimentation with the cube to tease out some rules that translated better to 3D (although due to the nature of code golf this was not a long period of experimentation).
The cubes tend to settle into a pattern after a while. I thought this looked kind of cool.
Also, the size of the individual cubes, their spacing and some other parameters are very easy to edit (at the start of the game file).

In the future (if I ever get round to it) I'll add in a gui so that many of the settings can be changed dynamically.
It would also be cool to add some raycasting selection method, so that users can experiment with their own attempts.
